# Ethical Spyware Projects

is a collection of projects exploring the vulnerabilities and potential threats that can exist in digital systems. These projects serve as a learning resource for understanding how these vulnerabilities can be exploited, and more importantly, how to protect against such exploits. The tools included are developed with an ethical, responsible perspective, intended for use in improving system defenses, conducting security testing, or for educational purposes. They are not intended for malicious use. Users are encouraged to use these tools responsibly and to respect all relevant laws and regulations. Remember, knowledge is power, but power should always be used ethically and responsibly.
